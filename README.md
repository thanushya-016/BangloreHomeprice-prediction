# Bangalore House Price Prediction Website

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Bangalore. Using historical data of property prices, the model can predict the price of a property based on its location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other features. The project demonstrates the entire workflow from data preprocessing, model building, and deployment to a web-based user interface for real-time predictions.

## Project Components

### 1. **Machine Learning Model**
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle's Bangalore home prices dataset.
- **Modeling**: The predictive model is developed using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression algorithm.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
  - Outlier Detection and Removal
  - Feature Engineering (creating new meaningful features)
  - Dimensionality Reduction
  - Model Evaluation using K-fold Cross-Validation

### 2. **Backend (Python Flask Server)**
- The Python Flask server serves as the backend to process the user's input and return predictions from the trained model.
- It handles the communication between the frontend and the machine learning model, returning accurate price predictions.

### 3. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)**
- A user-friendly web interface allows users to input property specifications such as location, size, and number of bedrooms.
- The frontend interacts with the Flask server to fetch predictions and displays the estimated property price on the website.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for model development and server-side logic.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the linear regression model.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for serving the model and handling HTTP requests.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Used for building the frontend of the application.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing libraries.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries used during data exploration.

## Key Highlights
- End-to-end deployment of a machine learning model, from data collection to web application development.
- Extensive use of data science techniques, including feature engineering, outlier detection, and model evaluation.
- A seamless interaction between the machine learning model and the web interface, providing real-time property price predictions.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more complex machine learning models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
- Expand the feature set with additional parameters such as property age, amenities, and proximity to landmarks for better predictions.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) for wider accessibility.
